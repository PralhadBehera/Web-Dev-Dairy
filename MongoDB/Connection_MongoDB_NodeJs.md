Certainly! Let's break down the code:

1. **Importing Dependencies**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require("express");
   const mongoose = require("mongoose");
   ```
   - `express`: This imports the Express.js framework, which is used for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
   - `mongoose`: This imports the Mongoose library, which provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with MongoDB databases in Node.js.

2. **MongoDB Connection URI**:
   ```javascript
   const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/FirstDB';
   ```
   - This is the connection URI for MongoDB. It specifies the protocol (`mongodb://`), the host (`localhost`) and port (`27017`) where MongoDB is running, and the name of the database (`FirstDB`) to connect to.

3. **Connecting to MongoDB**:
   ```javascript
   mongoose.connect(uri);
   ```
   - This line establishes a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose. It takes the MongoDB connection URI as an argument.

4. **Getting the Default Connection**:
   ```javascript
   const db = mongoose.connection;
   ```
   - This line retrieves the default Mongoose connection object, which represents the connection to MongoDB.

5. **Event Listeners for MongoDB Connection**:
   ```javascript
   db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
   db.once('open', function() {
     // Code to execute once the connection is open
   });
   ```
   - These lines set up event listeners for the MongoDB connection.
   - The `db.on('error', ...)` listener listens for any errors that occur during the connection process and logs them to the console using `console.error`.
   - The `db.once('open', ...)` listener listens for the `'open'` event, which indicates that the MongoDB connection is successfully established. Once this event occurs, it executes the callback function provided, in this case, logging a message to the console indicating that the connection to MongoDB was successful.

6. **Starting the Express App**:
   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   app.listen(3001, () => {
     console.log("Server connected");
   });
   ```
   - This code initializes an Express application and starts a server on port `3001`.
   - The `app.listen(...)` method starts the Express server, listening on the specified port (`3001`). It also logs a message to the console indicating that the server has been successfully started.

Overall, this code establishes a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose, sets up event listeners to handle connection errors and successful connection events, and starts an Express server once the MongoDB connection is established.

## Entire Code 

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/FirstDB';

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect(uri);

// Get the default connection
const db = mongoose.connection;

// Event listeners for the MongoDB connection
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', function() {
  console.log("Connected to MongoDB");

  // Start your Express app after MongoDB connection is established
  const app = express();
  app.listen(3001, () => {
    console.log("Server connected");
  });
});
```
