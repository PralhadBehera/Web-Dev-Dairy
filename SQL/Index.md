# Index 

Indexes in databases are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables. They work similarly to indexes in books, allowing the database to quickly locate specific rows in a table without having to scan the entire table


Here are some key points about indexes:

1. **Purpose**: Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of rows from a table. They provide a quick lookup mechanism based on the values of one or more columns.

2. **Types of Indexes**:

- ingle-column Index: Indexes created on a single column.
- Composite Index: Indexes created on multiple columns.
- Unique Index: Ensures that no two rows have the same values in the indexed columns.
- Clustered Index: Defines the physical order of the rows in the table based on the indexed column(s).
