# Normalization

- **First Normal Form (1NF):**
In 1NF, a table is said to be in first normal form if it satisfies the following conditions:
  - Each table cell must contain a single, atomic (indivisible) value.
  - Each column must have a unique name.
  - The order of rows and columns does not matter.

  - Example:
       Consider a table storing information about students and their courses:

| StudentID | Name           | Courses                 |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|
| 1         | John Doe       | Math, Science, History  |
| 2         | Jane Smith     | English, Math           |
| 3         | Michael Johnson| History, Science        |
