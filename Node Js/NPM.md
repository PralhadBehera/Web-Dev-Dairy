# NPM 

- NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is a package manager for JavaScript programming language. It is used to install, share, and manage dependencies in JavaScript projects

 - Developers can use NPM to install packages globally or locally in their projects.


# YARN

- Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript, developed by Facebook in collaboration with Exponent, Google, and Tilde. It was created as an alternative to npm (Node Package Manager) to address some of its limitations and improve performance


 | Feature                            | Yarn                                       | npm                                                |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Performance                        | Faster due to parallel downloads and caching | Slower than Yarn, but improved over time          |
| Caching                            | Caches every package downloaded             | Also has caching but may not be as robust          |
| Deterministic Dependency Resolution| Uses yarn.lock for consistent dependency resolution | Introduced package-lock.json for the same     |
| CLI and User Experience           | More concise and intuitive CLI             | Offers a wide range of commands and options        |
| Community and Ecosystem           | Slightly smaller ecosystem                 | Larger ecosystem with more packages available      |
