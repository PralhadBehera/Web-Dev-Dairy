| Feature                    | Template-driven Forms                                   | Model-driven (Reactive) Forms                             |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **How You Build the Form** | You mainly build the form in HTML using Angular        | You mainly build the form in TypeScript using Angular     |
| **Validation**             | You add validation rules directly in the HTML template  | You add validation rules in the TypeScript code          |
| **Handling Changes**       | Angular automatically handles form changes              | You explicitly manage form changes in TypeScript          |
| **Testing**                | Testing can be a bit tricky due to HTML dependencies   | Testing is generally easier because logic is in TypeScript|
| **Dynamic Forms**          | More challenging to create dynamic forms                | Easier to create dynamic forms                            |
| **Performance**            | May have performance issues with large or complex forms| Generally better performance, especially for big forms    |
| **Learning Curve**         | Easier for beginners                                    | Steeper learning curve, but more control once mastered    |
