| **Timing**      | Resources are loaded upfront during initialization. | Resources are loaded on-demand, typically asynchronously.    |
| **Initialization** | All necessary resources are fetched and initialized.  | Only essential resources are loaded upfront.                  |
| **Loading Time** | Longer initial loading times.                         | Shorter initial loading times.                                |
| **Performance**  | Immediate access to resources.                        | Deferred loading improves performance and user experience.    |
| **Usage**       | Suitable for smaller applications or when immediate access is required. | Beneficial for large applications with many resources.       |
| **Optimization** | May lead to unnecessary loading of unused resources.  | Optimizes resource usage by loading only what is needed.     |
