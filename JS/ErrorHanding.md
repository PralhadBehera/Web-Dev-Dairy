In JavaScript, error handling involves two main aspects: throwing errors and handling errors.

1. **Throwing Errors:**
   You can throw errors in JavaScript using the `throw` statement. This allows you to create custom error messages and indicate that something unexpected or exceptional has occurred during the execution of your code. You can throw any value, but it's common to throw instances of the `Error` object or its subclasses for better error handling.

   Example of throwing an error:

   ```javascript
   function divide(x, y) {
       if (y === 0) {
           throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
       }
       return x / y;
   }

   try {
       console.log(divide(10, 0));
   } catch (error) {
       console.error(error.message); // Output: Cannot divide by zero
   }
   ```

   In this example, if the second argument `y` is `0`, the `divide` function throws an error with the message "Cannot divide by zero".

2. **Error Handling:**
   Error handling involves catching and handling errors that are thrown within your code to prevent them from crashing your application. In JavaScript, you can handle errors using the `try...catch` statement.

   Example of error handling:

   ```javascript
   function divide(x, y) {
       if (y === 0) {
           throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
       }
       return x / y;
   }

   try {
       console.log(divide(10, 0));
   } catch (error) {
       console.error("An error occurred:", error.message); // Output: An error occurred: Cannot divide by zero
   } finally {
       console.log("Execution complete."); // Output: Execution complete.
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `try` block contains the code that might throw an error. If an error occurs, it's caught by the `catch` block, and you can handle it accordingly. The `finally` block (optional) executes regardless of whether an error occurs or not, making it useful for cleanup tasks.
