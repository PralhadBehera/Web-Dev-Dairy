Timers in JavaScript are used to execute code at a specified time or repeatedly at specified intervals. There are two main timer functions in JavaScript: `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.

1. **setTimeout():**
   This function is used to execute a function or piece of code once after a specified delay (in milliseconds).

   ```javascript
   setTimeout(function() {
       console.log("This message will be displayed after 2 seconds.");
   }, 2000); // 2000 milliseconds = 2 seconds
   ```

2. **setInterval():**
   This function is used to execute a function or piece of code repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each execution.

   ```javascript
   var intervalId = setInterval(function() {
       console.log("This message will be displayed every 3 seconds.");
   }, 3000); // 3000 milliseconds = 3 seconds
   ```

   You can use `clearInterval()` to stop the execution of code that was set up using `setInterval()`.

   ```javascript
   clearInterval(intervalId); // Stops the execution of the interval
   ```

These timers are often used in scenarios such as animation, periodic data retrieval from a server, or implementing timeout functionality in web applications. However, it's important to use them judiciously to avoid performance issues or unexpected behavior.
